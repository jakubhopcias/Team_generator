TEAM GENERATOR 0.2
----------
Description: 
	This program allows you to generate two random teams from a list of names.
It is written in Python and uses the random library to shuffle the names and divide
them into two teams. I would like to expand the project: add an API or make it work 
for odd number of names. This is my first project, which i hope will develop my
python skills and get to know Github better.
----------
Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Termcolor library (if you want to have 'team red' and 'team blue' colored)
----------
How to use:
1.Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2.Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3.Run the program using the following command:
4.Enter the names of the team members when prompted, separated by spaces.
5.The program will output the two teams with their respective members.
